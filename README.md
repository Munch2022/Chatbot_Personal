# Chatbot_Personal
This repo consists all related files to build an interactive GUI application chatbot which can answer questions about me

### Simple chatbot implementation with Python using tkinter for gui app.

â€¢	Created the chatbot from the scratch with python 

â€¢	NLP techniques are used to clean and process the data 

â€¢	Used a simple Dense neural net with 2 layers along with dropout

â€¢	One can customize own use case with just modifying the intents.json file with possible patterns and responses and re-run the training

ðŸ˜Ž I have trained this bot with my own details/basic information and the bot itself; named him SmartBot. So anybody can know about me chatting with my bot
Eg: greetings(hi, hello, whats up), who are you, what is your name, why do you call yourself smart?, who is Manjula, what are her skills, when is her birthday, what are her hobbies, what is her marital status?/ is she married, etc..
